1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf? 
Registers a0-a7 (x10-x17) contain functions' arguments. 
For main's call to printf, a2 holds 13.

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.) 
(CFLAGS=-O)
f: the call to function f has been optimized and the compiler leave constant 12 instead of the call to f.
g: the call to g has been optimized too and the code performs "x+3" in f instead of the call to g.
(CFLAGS=-O0)
f: jalr	-50(ra) # 1c <f>
g: jalr	-48(ra) # 0 <g>
3. At what address is the function printf located? 
0x0000000000000630

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main? 
jalr	1536(ra) # 630 <printf>
0x630 - 1536 = 48 = 0x30
ra = pc = 0x30

5. What is the output?
He110 World
Change i to 0x726c6400
Not need to change 57616.

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
x=3 y=1
The code didn't provice the 2st argument (a2) for printf. Therefore, printf use the old a2 register value.
